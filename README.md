## Project Components

### 1. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **2,000 customer transactions** from an e-commerce website, collected **daily after the “Add to Cart”** step of the customer journey. The data spans from **2019 to 2023** and includes a wide range of variables, each designed to provide detailed insights into customer behavior, order flow, and transactional outcomes.

Each transaction is uniquely identified to maintain data integrity and facilitate robust analytics.

This analysis extends to 5 main dimensions that will help us extract useful information for the dataset:

- Demographic analysis
- Geographical analysis
- Product-related analysis
- Transactional analysis
- Post-purchase analysis

The methodologies we are going to use to analyze dataset is descriptive and predictive. We firstly focus on understanding better the data and try to extract insights over data anomalies or correlations among values, analyze various events and behaviors and on the final stage, this analysis,will include **Reference-Frequency-Monetary Value (RFM)**, clustering techniques, and machine learning models for purchase probability prediction and revenue forecasting, based on the dataset provided
